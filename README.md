# React-TypeScript Shopping Cart project

This project is a simple shopping cart application built with React and TypeScript. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about React and TypeScript.

Deployed [üåù HERE](https://courageous-buttercream-dab68f.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone
cd react-typescript-shopping-cart
npm install
```

## Launching the data

One way is hard-coding;
Anther way is to use json-server to serve the data for the products, run the following command.
I used both here, watch the comments in the code.

```bash
npx json-server -w data/products.json -p 3500
```

To start the application, run the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Launch the application in the browser at
http://localhost:5173/
