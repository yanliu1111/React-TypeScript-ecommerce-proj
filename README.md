# React-TypeScript Shopping Cart project

This project is a simple shopping cart application built with React and TypeScript. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about React and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone
cd react-typescript-shopping-cart
npm install
```

Json-server is used to serve the data for the products. To start the server, run the following command.

```bash
npx json-server -w data/products.json -p 3500
```

To start the application, run the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Launch the application in the browser at
http://localhost:5173/
